## My process

-Build the html needed as designed
-Then add css in order to make it beautiful
-add media query for larger screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What i learned from this project is learning more about prioritizing mobile-first and then only using responsive media query to change the width when it gets to larger screens

### Useful resources
